This is the content of my very first post. Welcome to the site!

Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries.

*   It has no database abstraction layer.
*   No form validation.
*   Or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions.

It's simple, but very powerful.
